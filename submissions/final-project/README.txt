This is a very basic readme file that is meant to explain what each of the program files do. 

NOTE: Most of the files listed below will not compile and/or run due to the fact that for privacy reasons certain files and information have been excluded. 
However, the files submitted include certain ".p" files which are used by a python module named pickle to upload variables that were saved as a ".p" We have 
saved necessary data in this format and written our code such that you can reproduce any graph that we made.
